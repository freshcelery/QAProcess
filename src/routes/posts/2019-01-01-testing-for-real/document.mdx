<p> Okay so now we have a bunch of browsers open and Phones/Tablets crowding our desk. We know exactly how the feature SHOULD work. So let's get testing. </p>

<p> I like to go sequentially through the devices, especially when it is a new site or something you aren't completely familiar with. You will get better at this with time and learn to multi-task, but in the beginning quality over speed is ideal (this is QUALITY assurance afterall).
Generally start with Chrome, as it is the most used browser and probably what the developers are using when working on the feature. </p>

<p> Test the feature in full, this means making sure all the use cases are working as expected, the UI looks identical to the mockups, and things aren't starting to fall apart and break as you use it. 
This is the most basic form of QA, there is a lot more to it than just this but for the most part this tedious work is what 75% of the job is going to consist of. </p>

<p> If anythng breaks file a ticket (we will get to that soon), but if all goes well and the feature works perfectly in chrome (it really happens sometimes) we can move on to the next browser.
Rinse and repeat until you have gone through every browser and are confident that the feature is 100%. </p>
