<p>If you are new to PxU, you are going to be in a bunch of meetings where people are talking about semi-technical things using a bunch of terms and acronyms that make absolutely no sense to you. 
Here are a few of them to make your journey <i>slightly</i> less confusing.</p>

<ul>
 <li> <b>Shopify</b> - Hopefully you know this one already, but if not, Shopify is a big software company that created a platform for e-commerce. Basically for selling things on the internet in a way that makes sense. There is a lot involved with shopify, and hopefully as part of your onboarding you have created your own store and does some screwing around with it. If not, you should probably do that before moving forward with this. </li>
 <li> <b>PDP</b> - Product Display Page. This is the page in a Shopify store that displays a single product and the information about that product. Usually this is some sort of template page that can host any product in the store. Pretty will every site will have a PDP. </li>
 <li> <b>PLP</b> - Product List Page. This is a page in shopify where we list all of (or a collection of) the products for the user to look through. The PLP is another page you will spend a lot of time testing because basically every site has it. </li>
 <li> <b>ATC</b> - Add to Cart. This is (usually) a button for adding a product to your cart. Pretty self-explainitory. </li>
 <li> <b>RTE</b> - Rich Text Editor. This is a control for inputting text into a document or page, with some advanced controls. Usually it has the capability of adding some text formatting or the ability to add raw HTML and for it to be rendered in the outgoing document. </li>
 <li> <b>WYSIWYG</b> - What You See Is What You Get. This is an incredibly long term for a simple thing, basically a drag-and-drop templating system in which you put components onto a screen and it immediately shows what it will look like. Generally this is used instead of writing raw HTML/CSS as a basic way of building a webpage. </li>
 <li> <b>DR</b> - Design Review. This is a process done by the Designer to ensure that the actual implementation of their mockups looks as expected on a variety of different browsers and resolutions. This is usually done before QA begins (sometimes after QA is complete... yeah not an exact science) </li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li> <b>Figma</b> - This is a tool used by designers to create mockups of components used on the site. This is our go-to for figuring out how specific features or pages should look. Be sure to ask the designer on your team for access to the project's figma as soon as you can so you can get used to how it works.</li>
 <li> <b>Liquid</b> - This is a templating language used by shopify for creating pages in a shopify store. Something the devs are going to be using a lot and might not have an immediate impact on you but it is important to understand a bit about it. You can learn about it <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">here</a>. </li>
 <li> <b>Shogun</b> - This is an external application used for building more advanced pages to be used in a shopify store. You will probably end up using this to muck around with components created by developers so it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of how this works. Check it out <a href="https://getshogun.com/">here</a>. </li>
</ul>
