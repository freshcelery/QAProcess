<p> Okay, so we now know a little bit of vocabulary so we don't look completely lost when someone tells you to test the PDP. However, now that someone has told you that you actually have to start working you are back in the land of confusion. 
Well fear not, because I am here to hold your hand through the daunting process of looking at someone's hard work, finding all it's flaws, and then telling them (gently) to re-do it so it works better. </p>

<p>
The first thing to do is make sure you <b>COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE THING YOU ARE TESTING</b>. I can't stress this enough. Make sure you know as much as possible about the use cases and intended outcomes of the feature. This is often easier said than done, but a few things to keep in mind.
<ol>
 <li> Read the ticket multiple times. </li>
   <ul>
    <li> The feature ticket should have most (ideally all) of the necessary information required to test the ticket. Read over it and make sure you understand what you can before bugging someone.</li>
   </ul>
  
 <li>If there is something you don't understand, ask the developer.</li>
   <ul>
    <li> The developer should understand the thing you are testing, since they built it. They are generally a friendly bunch as long as you come to them with logical and understandable questions. </li>
   </ul>
 <li> If all else fails, ask the Project Manager. </li>
   <ul>
    <li> If neither the Feature Ticket or the Developer can help you understand what you are testing, go to the PM. Generally this is a bad sign but sometimes it happens and it is important that we make sure as a QA we have all the information required to deliver to the client a working version of what they want. </li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
</p>
<p> The biggest thing to take away from all that is that asking questions is a good thing. We are all in this crazy mess of software development together, and asking questions is usually the best way of figuring out what the hell is going on. </p>

<p> Now that you understand the intent and use cases of a feature it is time to test, right? <b>WRONG</b>.</p>

<p>You now know what is intended on a functional level, but you probably don't know what it should look like. In the world of modern web development, what things look like is sometimes more important than how it functions. Due to this our next step is to look at mockups. At PxU we use Figma, so open up the Figma project and find the component you are going to test and take a good look at it. Since design is so important, you have to get an eagle eye for discrepencies between the live site and mockups. Ideally the live site will look as close to the mockups as possible, including across browsers. There should be mockups for each feature/page on at least Desktop and Mobile (maybe tablet too).</p>
